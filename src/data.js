Not only are they able to equalize their duties of both motherhood and entrepreneurship but also, they comprise of almost half of all businesses owned. Today, more women are breaking free from the traditional, gender-specific roles and venturing into the business world. The last decade has witnessed a dramatic increase in both- the number of women entrepreneurs as well as the success rate of their initiatives. From being a minority in the entrepreneurial ecosystem ten years ago, women today comprise of 37% of the world’s total entrepreneurs. The recent Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) found 126 million women starting or running businesses, and 98 million operating established (over three and a half years) businesses. That’s 224 million women impacting the global economy — and this survey counts only 67 of the 188 countries recognized by the World Bank.",
      para3 : "Much of a business woman’s drive to pursue entrepreneurship is due to the immense passion she has for her work. Another motivating factor behind women entrepreneurs is the desire for control. Many successful female business owners are provoked by the opportunity to be their own boss and run their own company, a prospect that would never occur if they had worked for someone else. Their primary goal is not monetary reward but rather personal satisfaction and community involvement. Another inspiring component that many successful women entrepreneurs share is the fact that they have the ability to multitask and also the tendency to balance family life and career with their goal-oriented approach.",
      para4 : "Women entrepreneurs are assembling themselves into groups or confederacies. The reasons behind this trend have to do with the desire to establish solid women business networks, where members can collectively pool resources and expertise together. Also, the government schemes and the numerous women Entrepreneurship associations like Federation of Indian Women Entrepreneurs have been instrumental in providing an incentive as well as the resources to step into the world of entrepreneurship. It’s no coincidence that states with higher literacy rate have more number of women entrepreneurs. In fact, women entrepreneurs in the four southern states and Maharashtra account for over 50% of all women-led small-scale industrial units in India."

The startup should develop a milestone-based plan with clear timelines regarding what the startup wishes to do in the next 2, 4, and 10 years. A financial forecast is a carefully constructed projection of company development over a given time period, taking into consideration projected sales data, as well as market and economic indicators.

I graduated from National Institute of Technology, Rourkela in 2014. I tried starting up by myself with a previous startup named UNE-AMP, with my childhood friend. Without a formidable team and due to lack of resources and money, the startup eventually crumbled down. ",

The penetration of the startup ecosystem is next to nothing in most parts of India. Being engineers and doctors prevail in Indian households. It is exciting starting up from Bangalore or Pune or Mumbai. But Odisha still has a lack of the very much needed startup culture. Being from a middle-class family entwines the dissatisfaction of the parents and relatives alike. Drawing examples of gross failure and bankruptcy, the blood relatives makes the endeavors for starting up much gruesome. As Phoenix Robotix grew up to a bigger team and better revenue, gradually investors started trickling in. Due to the lack of resources and simplicity in governmental forums for startups, we were unable to gain much exposure for growth and awareness. But eventually, we became DIPP recognized startup with Udyog Aadhaar Number and other formalities to become a legit candidate to avail incentives under Startup India. ",

We were working on a cost-effective ambient air quality monitoring system against the much costly CPCB owned monitoring stations installed in cities. A hell lot of research and a devilish lot of hard work paved the way for where we are now. We have eventually named the device as Aurassure, trademarked and patented it. We started taking part in competitions and we got selected in the Innovate for Digital India Challenge in the top 50 teams. Gradually, we achieved the top 20 and finally the top 10. In this journey, we were obliged to meet the Honorable President of India Dr. Pranab Mukherjee and presented our idea before him in Rashtrapati Bhawan. With our CPCB and SPCB, Odisha authorized Online Data Transmission System, we have successfully acquired 50 clients in Industries and Mines with 100+ on-field deployments in Odisha. ",

We are striving to bring the best services to the Industries and Organizations so that they can save on energy, money and time. As everything always seems new and unknown, the little problems escalate to a mammoth size. This has led to many unforeseen errors in the execution of business operations in our company before. But mistakes are committed only to learn from them. We are an ISO 9001:2015 certified company holding three patents and many other prizes only through amusing and serious mistakes and errors in management which have eventually corrected our course. The most important thing for any startup is its team and its idea. ",
      para5: "How scalable and flexible are both of them, are what a startup is all about. Quite really, what we thought about the idea to start up with, never became the ultimate agenda of our company. We have scaled up to $ 5 million valuations and is working in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in a B2B framework. The most important thing to remember is, at the end of the day we are all selling ourselves. So, make it count because what experiences we gain and how beautiful it becomes, in the end, are what define our choices we make in life. After all, it is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities."

There has been a steady shift towards treating ESG as more than just an involuntary mandate. While investors are looking for meaningful enterprises to place their bet on, women entrepreneurs are also making effective changes in the right direction. It can be argued that a key focus area of women-led start-ups is sustainability and the trend is reflected in industries across dynamic products, services, and practices.",

Else the user will look somewhere else for the products. The text-based searches return a list of items that include those keywords in the title name and the description. This may not be the best technique to find the accurate results. Artificial intelligence techniques allow users to upload the images and discover the most relevant or exact search result. This saves a lot of time for the consumer as a consumer no longer have to linger for hours. ",

Well, this is the application of artificial intelligence in E-commerce. AI and machine learning algorithms can predict the behavior of buyer from its past searches, likings, frequently bought products. By predicting the behavior of the user, E-commerce websites are able to recommend the products that user is highly interested in. This improves the user experience as the user no longer have to spend hours searching the product. It also helps the E-commerce websites to improve their sales. So, small E-commerce websites have to build own recommendation system. "
